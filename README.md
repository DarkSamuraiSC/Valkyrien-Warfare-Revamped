[![Build 
Status](https://jenkins.daporkchop.net/job/Valkyrien-Warfare-Revamped/badge/icon)](https://jenkins.daporkchop.net/job/Valkyrien-Warfare-Revamped/)

## The Airships Mod to end all other Airships Mods. Better compatibility, performance, collisions, interactions and physics than anything prior!

## Also the airship mod of The FutureÂ®

### Setting up
Setting this mod up is exactly the same as with any other mod, just throw it in your `mods` folder and start MC! If you want to develop for it, clone the repo, (if you're using Eclipse you'll also need to copy in the `eclipse/` folder from a fresh installation of the [Forge MDK](http://files.minecraftforge.net), ) then use `./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace eclipse` (Linux/Mac + Eclipse) or `./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace genIntellijRuns` (Linux/Mac + IntelliJ) or `gradlew.bat setupDecompWorkspace eclipse` (Windows + Eclipse) or `gradlew.bat setupDecompWorkspace genIntellijRuns` (Windows + IntelliJ).
